# Halo CE - Revised (Gearbox Halo PC)
The "Revised" tagset provides bug fixes and quality improvements for the tags and data
provided with the Halo Custom Edition Halo Editing Kit.

This project aims to provide an updated drop-in replacement for the official HEK tagset release.

This project does not set out to make changes that affect the playstyle or atmosphere of the game.
Instead the goal is to fix bugs that occurred during the Halo PC porting process.

## Difference from Halo CE "Refined"
Unlike the Refined tagset, by default this asset release does not use workarounds or hacks to try and
imitate the visuals of the Xbox version on Halo PC's buggy engine, instead this release
fixes bugs with the Halo PC content while keeping within the intended tag features of Halo PC.

The benefit to this is the tags will still work as intended when run on an engine that fixes
the core engine issues, be it [MCC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/976730/Halo_The_Master_Chief_Collection/) or Halo Custom Edition with [CEnshine](https://github.com/Sledmine/censhine) and [Chimera](https://github.com/SnowyMouse/chimera) Installed.

As a result this tagset keeps the Halo PC `shader_transparent_chicago` shaders that stand-in for the lack of `shader_transparent_generic` support.

## Engine support
Cache files (maps) can be compiled for the following engines from these tags:

- Halo PC (2003 retail)
- Halo Trial
- Halo Custom Edition

## Notice
This tagset does not use any tags directly copied from the Halo MCC CE editing tools. Instead all data is derived
from the Gearbox version, and is assumed to remain under the Halo Custom Edition EULA.
