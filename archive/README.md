This directory contains tags that are no-longer part of any build target for various reasons.
They are stored here to preserve them should anyone want to use them.
### /old_bitmaps
This contains bitmaps that have been replaced in the main tagset.
In most cases these are seemingly older bitmaps used in Halo PC that have been restored back to the Xbox versions,
however in some cases the PC versions are kept and the Xbox tags are here instead.

The tags are as follows:

- 1749-era bitmaps that somehow ended up back in Halo PC.
```
characters\captain\bitmaps\captain_body.bitmap
characters\floodcombat_human\bitmaps\floodhuman_damaged.bitmap
```

- Alternate version of `metal strips wide 1 bump` only seen in Halo PC.
```
levels\b30\bitmaps\metal strips wide 1 bump.bitmap
```

- Version of `flood_captain_multi` that is missing the blood streaks. Only seen in Halo PC.
```
characters\flood_captain\bitmaps\flood_captain_multi.bitmap
```

- Poorly edited version of armored `marine_legs` seen in Halo PC. Not sure what this was trying to fix.
```
characters\marine_armored\bitmaps\marine_legs.bitmap
characters\marine_armored\bitmaps\marine_legs_multipurpose.bitmap
```

- half-resolution version of `metal panels generator bump` only seen in Halo PC.
```
levels\b40\bitmaps\b40_metal panels generator bump.bitmap
```

- Version of the unit meters drawn by Gearbox.
```
"ui\hud\bitmaps\combined\hud_unit_backgrounds.bitmap"
"ui\hud\bitmaps\combined\hud_unit_meters.bitmap"
```

- At some point in 2002 Bungie themselves fixed the sniper scope to say 2x - 8x for later Xbox builds. This is the previous 2x - 10x texture from the earlier Xbox releases.
```
ui\hud\bitmaps\sniper\hud_reticles_scope.bitmap
```

- A blue-accented version of the plasma pistol. They were used on Xbox before being corrected to green for PC.
```
weapons\plasma pistol\bitmaps\plasma pistol.bitmap
weapons\plasma pistol\bitmaps\plasma pistol_card.bitmap
```

- Xbox version of flamethrower base. It was edited slightly when made into a proper weapon.
```
weapons\flamethrower\bitmaps\flamethrower.bitmap
```

- Alternate version of the shotgun shell texture seen in Halo PC. It looks way too bright with that multipurpose.
```
weapons\shotgun\bitmaps\shotshell multipurpose.bitmap
weapons\shotgun\bitmaps\shotshell.bitmap
```

### /original_pc_resolution_hud
HUD bitmaps using the same texture resolution as stock Halo PC. Does not depend on mods implementing both MCC and custom flags.
