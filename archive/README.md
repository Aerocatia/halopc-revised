This directory contains tags that are no-longer part of any build target for various reasons.
They are stored here to preserve them should anyone want to use them.
### /old_bitmaps
This contains bitmaps that have been replaced in the main tagset.
In most cases these are seemingly older bitmaps used in Halo PC that have been restored back to the Xbox versions.

The tags are as follows:

- Alternate version of `metal strips wide 1 bump` only seen in Halo PC.
```
levels\b30\bitmaps\metal strips wide 1 bump.bitmap
```

- half-resolution version of `metal panels generator bump` only seen in Halo PC.
```
levels\b40\bitmaps\b40_metal panels generator bump.bitmap
```

- A blue-accented version of the plasma pistol. They were used on Xbox before being corrected to green for PC.
